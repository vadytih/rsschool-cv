My goal is to make in the treasure a project of the world project for the benefit of humanity. Simplify everyday tasks with digital technology.
I want to bring my skills to the highest level in the field of Javascript. Gain experience and become a strong fullstack developer.
Experience in a team of professionals and communication with experienced developers are very important to me. It is also very important for me to develop as a fullstack Javascript developer.
Javascript is the only language that runs on the client side and can also run on the server. It is very attractive to me. Javascript is developing very well, and it's great.

I study Javascript very hard. I consider myself disciplined, punctual and responsible in any work. I am constantly looking for new information and software technologies. I love science, especially space.

My skills:
HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, Git, BAM, JavaScrip, NODE JS, Webpack, Gulp. 

I took two courses at EPAM IT Academy.
1) Website development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 108 academic hours (three months).
2) Development of web applications in JavaScript. 116 academic hours (three months).
